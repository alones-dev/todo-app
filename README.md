# **📝 Todo App**

Welcome to the **TaskManager App**! 🎉  
This is a full-stack web application built with **Next.js** (React) for both the front-end and back-end, using **Prisma** for data management and **PostgreSQL** for data storage. The app allows users to easily manage their tasks on a **calendar**, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks. Each task is linked to a user's account, allowing them to view their tasks at any time.
